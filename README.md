This is all the codes for my dissertation "Dimensionality reduction methods for detecting clusters: how do we uncover hidden patterns?"

Step 0. Ignore all the "draft".
Step 1. Simulate the datasets by running "R_3 types of single cell RNA simulated data" using R.
Step 2. The files named as "model X" are the deep learning models I use in the dissertation. The main code in each file is named as "(model name)_main or _run". 
All the codes are modified from the origional codes of their authors.
Model 1: https://github.com/ttgump/scDeepCluster
Model 2: https://github.com/ttgump/scDCC
Model 3: https://github.com/xuebaliang/scziDesk
Step 3. The files named as "UMAP and t-sne" or "charts" are the ways I make the plots in the essay using python.
